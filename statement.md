# Problem Statement 
Running a hotel with just pen and paper or messy spreadsheets is often a recipe for disaster—records get lost, guests accidentally get double-booked, and calculating bills becomes a headache. This project solves that chaos by building a smart digital assistant using Python that handles the heavy lifting automatically. Instead of shuffling through pages, the system instantly tracks which rooms are free, manages guest details, and calculates accurate bills in seconds, ensuring that all data is safely stored and the hotel runs smoothly without the manual stress.
