 # Steps to install and run the projects:-
  - Clone or download the repository to your local computer.
  - Ensure Python 3.x is installed. (Test with python --version)
  - Ensure Dbms app such as mysql is installed in the system.
  - Navigate to the project directory in a terminal.
  - Pandas library preinstalled 
  - Matplotlib library preinstalled 
  - Ms-Office Pre-installed for documentation
                         

 #Instructions for testing:-

 
 Phase 1: Setup & Initialization
 - Goal: Ensure the system creates the necessary storage files.
 - Run the code.
 
- Check your folder: Look for three new files created automatically:
  rooms.csv
  customer.csv
  transaction.csv
Phase 2: Add Master Data (Prerequisites)
- You need data to work with before performing transactions.
- Test A: Add a Room
- Select Option 1 (ROOMS) -> Option 1 (Add New Rooms).
- Enter Inputs:
- Room no: 101
- Floor no: 1
- Room Type: Deluxe
- Charge: 5000
- Facilities: Wifi,AC
- Status: V (Crucial: Must be 'V' for Vacant)
- Validation: Open rooms.csv (or use the Analytics menu) to see if this row exists.
- Test B: Add a Customer
- Select Option 2 (CUSTOMERS) -> Option 1 (Add Customers).
- Note the ID: The system should auto-generate an ID (likely 1 if it's the first customer).
- Enter Inputs:
- Name: Rahul
- Age: 25
- Contact: 9876543210
- Address: Mumbai
 
Phase 3: The Check-In Process (Booking)
- Goal: Link a Customer to a Room.
- Select Option 3 (CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT) -> Option 1 (Check-in a Room).
- Enter Inputs:
- Customer ID: 1 (Or whatever ID was generated in Phase 2).
- Room No: 101.
- Date Input: Be careful with the format!
- Date of booking: 20/11/2025 (Format: dd/mm/yyyy).
- Verification:
- Go to Option 5 (ANALYTICS) -> Option 1 (All Rooms).
- Look at Room 101. The status should now be 'O' (Occupied).

Phase 4: The Check-Out Process (Billing)
- Goal: Release the room and calculate the bill.
- Select Option 3 (CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT) -> Option 2 (Check-out).
- Enter Inputs:
- Customer ID: 1
- Room No: 101
- Date Input: Enter a date after the check-in date.
- Date of check-out: 25/11/2025
- Expected Output:
- The system calculates 5 days.
- Bill: 5 * 5000 = 25000.
 " Check out done Successfully..."
- Verification:
- Check Option 5 (ANALYTICS) -> Option 1. Room 101 should be 'V' (Vacant) again.

Phase 5: Analytics & Search
- Goal: Test if the query system works.
- Select Option 5 (ANALYTICS).
- Try Option 3 (Search Rooms) -> Enter 101.
- Try Option 5 (Search Customer) -> Enter 1.
- Try Option 7 (Booked Room Date wise) -> Enter 20/11/2025.

Phase 6: Edge Case Testing (Trying to Break It)
- Good testing involves trying to crash the system. Try these inputs:
- Invalid Room Check-in: Try to Check-in Room 101 while it is already Occupied.
- Expected: System should say "Room not Vacant".
- Non-Existent Data: Try to Delete Customer ID 999.
- Expected: System should say "Customer is not found".
- Wrong Date Format: Enter date as 2025-11-20 instead of 20/11/2025.
- Expected: The program will crash (ValueError) because the code specifically looks for %d/%m/%Y.
